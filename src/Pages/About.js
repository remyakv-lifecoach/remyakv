                                        <p className="mb-30">Hello, I am Remya , mom to a toddler girl, a yoga enthusiast , a
                                            software engineer and a
                                            Life coach. Hailing from a small village in Kerala, I never had any big dreams in
                                            life.
                                            All I remember was I wanted to become a teacher. When I finished my Engineering
                                            degree
                                            in IT, I went on to become a software engineer and went with the hustle and bustle
                                            of
                                            corporate world.</p>
                                        <p className="mb-30">
                                            Over the years I felt something missing in my life. I was not feeling happy in the
                                            work
                                            I do. I started doing self development courses to raise my confidence and self
                                            belief.
                                            Eventually I got training under a life coach which brought massive transformation
                                            within
                                            me. I found my purpose in life. I started loving myself. I am in love with the
                                            person I
                                            became. I started believing that I can bring the same kind of transformation in
                                            others .
                                        </p>
                                        <p className="mb-30">

                                            For me, helping people transform their lives to live meaningful life is the noble
                                            thing
                                            to do. So thatâ€™s how I choose to became a life coach.</p>
